### Hello! Catherine Jeon here. 👋
I am a 2nd-year graduate student at Ewha Womans University in Seoul, pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science and Engineering. Currently, I work as a graduate research assistant under the supervision of [Prof. S.E. Oh](https://sites.google.com/view/ewha-aisec/), and as a part-time graduate research assistant with [Prof. N. Kim](https://www.noorikim.com/bio) at Purdue University. Previously, I worked as an undergraduate research assistant with [Prof. S.E. Oh](https://sites.google.com/view/ewha-aisec/) at Ewha Womans University and as a graduate research assistant with [Prof. M.S. Rahman](https://iqseclab.rahmanmsaidur.com) at the University of Texas at El Paso.

Broadly, I'm dedicated to **advancing AI agents that can address real-world challenges and ultimately enhance human life**. To achieve this goal, I focus on two core missions:

(1) Developing **_reliable_** agents that remain robust and effective under real-world conditions. It is well known that even frontier models can fail dramatically in noisy, out-of-distribution, or concept-drifted environments. This creates the need for AI agents that are not only effective on benchmark datasets, but also robust and dependable in real-world deployment. To this end, I use methodologies such as contrastive learning, metric learning, feature embedding networks, data augmentation, and normalization.

(2) Building **_efficient_** systems that reduce the computational and data requirements. In an era where AI technologies are rapidly scaling up, we often face substantial memory, compute, and data costs, which form a major bottleneck to the accessibility of AI. We can address this problem across the entire AI stack and pipeline, from hardware to software and from dataset construction to model inference. In this line of work, I have explored techniques such as continual learning, generative replay, few-shot learning, and data-efficient learning methods, and have published multiple papers.

Building on my background, I am currently deeply interested in (1) developing (1) **developing versatile and robust models** and (2) **designing efficient models that can simulate our complex, physical real-world**.
